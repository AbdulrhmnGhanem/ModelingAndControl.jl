# what is this repo?
Here I keep track of the code I used for some books I am studying during my masters<sup>1</sup>.
So far it includes the implementation of two books using julia:

1. [Practical MATLAB Modeling with Simulink](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-5799-9)
2. [Mastering System Identification in 100 Exercises](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781118218532)
